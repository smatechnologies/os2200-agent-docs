# Introduction

The installation files for the Unisys OS 2200 LSAM, the LMAM, and the BIS MAM reside on the OpCon/xps installation media. These files must be transferred via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or must be copied to the Unisys OS 2200 system for installation. The estimated installation time is 15 to 20 minutes.
