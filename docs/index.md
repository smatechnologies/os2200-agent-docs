# OS2200 Agent

The OS 2200 LSAM and BIS LMAM, Version 15R1A, are OpCon agents that allow OpCon to schedule OS 2200 and BIS jobs within a Unisys environment.

**Windows File Names**

Some systems will not allow long file names (e.g., ```C:\Program Files\OpConxps\```). To work around this, revert to method 8.3. In this method, the 7th character becomes a tilde followed by a 1 (e.g., ```C:\Progra~1\OpConxps\```).
